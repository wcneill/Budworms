# Numerical Methods
This repository started as a home-made Runge-Kutta algorithm applied to a system of ODEs describing the population dynamics of the eastern spruce budworm in Canada's spruce forests (Ludwig 1978). This was my Master's graduate research project.

Now this repository serves as a drop box of efforts to improve my knowledge in the area of numerical methods, data visualization, modeling and analysis.

You may use my code without permission, at your own risk. A shout-out would be cool but uneccissary.
